Here is a great joke I heard on dynamic vs static typing:

A C# developer and a Python developer order some cat food online.
By mistake, the seller accidentally sends both developers some thumb tacks instead of cat food.
The C# developer calls the seller and complains: "You sent me the wrong item. I ordered cat food, but you sent me thumb tacks instead. Please send me some cat food."
The Python developer calls the seller and complains: "My cats are dead."
